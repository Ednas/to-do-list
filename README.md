# to-do-list
A quick Angular app to do list

Followed a tutoril to build this to do list. Directions can be found here: http://medialoot.com/blog/angularjs-for-absolute-beginners/

If you follow the directions, note that ``` <span>{{ todo }}</span> ``` is missing in their source files and is necessary to display the to do list once it's been moved from HTML code to the script.js file.
